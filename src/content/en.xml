Introduction
</h2>
<p>Avoiding common styling problems is simple. And you only need
efficient CSS. Nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>ECSS sets simple rules for simple styling.</strong> No more
naming everything, no more technological dependencies. Only intentional,
consistent, simple, expressive, predictable, sustainable CSS.</p>

<h2 id="why-ecss">Why ECSS?</h2>
<p>Because CSS as a language is misunderstood and undeservedly maligned.
Because simple rules and low impact tools can go a long way in making
sure the CSS codebase is light, simple and scalable. ECSS is a global
approach to producing efficient design systems with CSS.</p>
</section>
</div>
<section>
<h2 id="values">Values</h2>
<div style="--DivItemBasis: 20rem;">
<section>
<h3 id="intentionality">Intentionality</h3>
<p><strong>Clear objectives, rational decisions.</strong></p>
<p>Every parcel of CSS has an objective. This objective should be clear
to anyone reading the code. Be it HTML or CSS. Selectors are the perfect
vehicle for intentionality. ECSS incentivizes the use of rational
selectors.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="consistency">Consistency</h3>
<p><strong>Repeating patterns save time &amp; energy.</strong></p>
<p>Flexible naming guidelines give the codebase a consistency
encouraging standardization and reuse. Prefixes and usage guidelines
enforced through linting insures everyone on your team will follow ECSS
rules.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p><strong>“Simple” is writing less code &amp; and limiting
dependencies.</strong></p>
<p>Class soup &amp; divitis aren’t simple. Untold numbers of media
queries aren’t either. But modern CSS is. By accepting CSS for what it
is (a designing language!) you can do <em>a lot</em> of styling mileage
with very little code.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="expressivity">Expressivity</h3>
<p><strong>Code that speaks for itself is actually
achievable.</strong></p>
<p>“thumbnail as-circle with-border” is instantly understandable while
“h-10 w-10 bdr-50 br-1 overh” is not. Code should communicate
information. The clearer the information, the easier it is to understand
the system. Mistaken semantics should give way to expressiveness.
Expressive best practices work.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="predictability">Predictability</h3>
<p><strong>Using simple but consistent authoring rules leads to
predictability.</strong></p>
<p>It feels good to dive into unknown code… while already knowing what
it looks like. Consistency, repeating patterns, simplicity (yes, again)
all coalesce into predictable code. And predictable code means less
stress, less friction and happier teams!</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h3>
<p><strong>Vanilla CSS is future ready.</strong></p>
<p>In practice it means being at the forefront of progress and
evolution. No need to wait for third parties to implement new features.
You can use clamp() as of now and say goodbye to 80% of your media
queries. No more <code class="sourceCode html">sm-this md-that</code>.
Only clean and modern code.</p>

<h2 id="principles">Guiding principles</h2>
<article>
<h3 id="designing-language">CSS is a <em>designing</em> language, not a
programming one.</h3>
<p>CSS authoring should reflect <em>design</em> patterns, concepts and
perspectives. With global (sorry) scales, tokens, rules, etc. you limit
repetition and facilitate future styling extension.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="design-empowerment">Empowering designers to refine their work
autonomously is efficient.</h3>
<p>Making the needed parts of CSS being intelligible (code-savvy or
not!) to designers cuts stress, time and promotes good allocation of
human resources, refining design in the browser is a great vector of
economic profitability.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="properties-not-equal">Not all CSS properties are born
equal.</h3>
<p>The box-model properties (<code
class="sourceCode css">display</code>, <code
class="sourceCode css">position</code>, <code
class="sourceCode css">width</code>, etc.) are extremely sensitive and
potentially way more disruptive than, say, color or type ones. The
former are the stuff of professional CSS authors and the latter are the
ones designers should be able to use, modify and experiment with in
context.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="specific-role">Properties &amp; units have specific roles and
usage.</h3>
<p>Limiting their use to these roles enhances clarity and promotes
consistency as well as predictability. The same goes for units. Some
suggest type, others, images or rhythm. Use them intentionally &amp;
rationally to communicate meaning.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="component-structure">Components and patterns <em>need</em>
structure.</h3>
<p>Trying to abstract it away is vain. Instead, documentation and
dilligence are key. HTML is semantically rich, so choose the right tags
and refrain from changing them for superficial reasons. One would not
remove or change <code
class="sourceCode html">class=&quot;header&quot;</code> without
understanding its purpose first, then one should not change or remove
<code
class="sourceCode html"><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">header</span><span class="dt">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="kw">header</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></code>
on a whim either.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="selector-intention">CSS Selectors are vehicles for
intention.</h3>
<p>Every selector particle must have a purpose and if not, must be
discarded with. This extraneous <code class="sourceCode css">div</code>
in <code
class="sourceCode css"><span class="fu">.card</span> div h2</code> is
what makes CSS brittle. These are <em>not</em> <a
href="https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/">“best
practices”</a>.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="selector-function">Selector types all have a function.</h3>
<p>Each one of them may be of use in a certain context. No absolute
usage rule should be edicted. It’s not “always” or “never” but “it
depends” and “why”. Absolute rules absolutely corrupt. Or something like
that.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="harness-specificity">Selection specificity should be harnessed,
not rejected.</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, “always” (ahem) keep it as low as possible. Yes, in
2015 it may have not been easy. But it’s 2023 and <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers">new</a>
<a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where">features</a>
are now widely supported. Use them.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="global-scope">Global scope in CSS is not a sin.</h3>
<p>Remember, <em>CSS is a designing language</em> and the global scope
fits perfectly in design’s fundamentally layered, dimensional approach.
Programming best practices are not necessarily designing best practices.
Embrace design best practices.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="global-rules">Global design rules must be largely anonymous
&amp; unqualified.</h3>
<p>Only a few declarations per ruleset only. We are talking rhythm,
typography, color; not <code class="sourceCode css">display</code> or
<code class="sourceCode css">position</code>. <em>This</em> is the way
of limiting repetition, bloat &amp; complexity.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="understood-concept">One should wait until a concept is clearly
understood before naming it.</h3>
<p>Until then use HTML elements. Premature abstraction or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overengineering">“solving problems
not yet encountered”</a> are bigger problems than the use of <code
class="sourceCode css">header</code> in CSS. Yes, these are programming
best practices. But who told you CSS development was pure?</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="rule-repetition">When more than 3 rules are repeated more than 3
times, a concept <em>is</em> emerging.</h3>
<p>Rules should then be concentrated by naming and using said concept
instead of the bare rules. Reusability, expressivity and simplicity are
then greatly improved.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="autonomous-concept">Named concepts must be autonomous and
self-sufficient.</h3>
<p>Named concepts should not be defined inside another named concept. If
it ever is necessary, the child concept must be scoped to the parent
concept and is <em>not</em> to be reused anywhere else.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="concept-manipulation">Manipulating named concepts throughout
multiple files is strictly prohibited.</h3>
<p>All rules for a named concept must reside in the same, unique CSS
file. For authors and maintainers to have confidence in the system,
there must a single <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth">source of
truth</a> for any concept.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="child-concepts">State, variant or structural are child concepts
and must be namespaced &amp; prefixed.</h3>
<p>These concepts may be represented as child or combined classes. Never
to be used alone, always alongside the parent concept. Yes, here are
both “never” <em>and</em> “always” in the same sentence. <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z58eTP2gcw0">“Double jeopardy, we
are fine”</a>.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="child-specificity">Namespaced classes should generally be
implemented with specificity reducing selectors.</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise needed, one should strive to keep specificity at 21
or below. With a preference for around 10 to 12. Modern and widely
supported pseudo-selectors must here be used.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="selector-efficiency">One may not come up at first with the
efficient way to select interface elements.</h3>
<p>One’s intention may not be clear at the beginning of a styling job.
Instead of fruitlessly trying and trying, a code “quarantine” file
should be temporarily used until the right selection manifests itself.
Still, no quarantine file should ever be published publicly.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="expressive-html">HTML should be as simple and expressive as can
be.</h3>
<p>Refrain from over-containing, don’t use <code
class="sourceCode html"><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">div</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></code>
where you could use <code
class="sourceCode html"><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">aside</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></code>.
Dont wrap your single-level navigation in unordered lists. And yes,
simple navigation is <a
href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2019/11/29/using-nav-without-a-list-element">accessible</a>.
Keep it simple… Suzy.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="one-role">Any HTML element should endorse one role only.</h3>
<p>As per the famous programming <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">best
practice</a> (again, programming in designing), semantic tags are for…
semantics whilst <code
class="sourceCode html"><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">div</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></code>
or <code
class="sourceCode html"><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">span</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></code>
tags are for graphical or logical division. Any type of grid should be
implemented with <code
class="sourceCode html"><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">div</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></code>
tags.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="adaptation-included">Any media query adaptation must be included
in its related concept’s file.</h3>
<p>Not as as a separate file, not as suffixed classes. If one uses
utility classes, the provided rules should not be query dependent but
rather be universally needed, in every media configuration.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="global-stylesheet">Whole stylesheets are better used when
global.</h3>
<p>Media query scopes should be used in HTML <code
class="sourceCode html"><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">link</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></code>
tags to promote reuse, performance and optimization concerns. Each
fundamental design layer should be autonomous, independent and
removable.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="component-styling">Component styling should only be served with
live components.</h3>
<p>Not as a big minified file in the <code
class="sourceCode html"><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">head</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></code>
tag of the document. This way, the infamous problem of loading unused
CSS is practically solved, without any technological debt. First render
is also faster since only what is used is processed by the browser. As a
bonus, you get the CSS file path in component file.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="browser-rendering">Let the browser do as much of the rendering
work as it can.</h3>
<p>By embracing fluidity, adaptativity is mostly done by the browser.
Less rules are needed to insure correct rendering in the infinite number
of usage contexts.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="devtools">Make full use of freely available development tools by
going with the grain of the Web platform.</h3>
<p>By using “just-in-time” rulesets, design tokens, the cascade and
intentional selection, the debugging &amp; refining workflow is simpler,
lighter and clearer.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h3 id="native-code">Eschewing technological abstractions like
high-level frameworks spurs lighter, simpler native code.</h3>
<p>By writing native CSS, one uses CSS better; by writing native HTML,
one writes HTML better. With better CSS and better HTML comes a better
user experience.</p>

<p>By hiding the way browsers treat overflowing items, we may hide
content without knowing. By using <code
class="sourceCode css">auto</code> instead of <code
class="sourceCode css">hidden</code>, the oveflowing content will be
accessible <em>and</em> the scrollbar will signal the design problem
instead of hiding it. Hiding scrollbars may be necessary in some
particular composition (see this very site’s portrait adaptation for an
example!).</p>

<p>Numbers may convey intention in grid system cases as in, for example,

CSS. The <a
